### ✅ Mini Concept Learning: Context Data & Processing Rules

#### ☝🏻 What is Context Data?
- When sending events via Web SDK or AppMeasurement, custom data can be sent through the `contextData` object.

- Example:
  ```js
  s.contextData['product.category'] = "Smartphone";
  s.contextData['product.color'] = "Black";
  ```

#### ✌🏻 What are Processing Rules?
- Configured in Adobe Analytics Admin.
- Map Context Data → eVar, prop, or event for reporting.
- Adjust data collection logic without code changes, improving maintainability.

### 📝 Naming Best Practices
- Use lowercase keys, avoid spaces/special characters  
- Adopt namespace-style keys (`category.productType`)  
- Keep consistent naming across multiple Report Suites  

---

### ✅ Practical Points
- If **data appears in Debugger but not in reports → most likely due to missing Processing Rule**.  
- Checklist:
  1. Verify Context Data key names  
  2. Ensure Processing Rules exist  
  3. Confirm the correct Report Suite is receiving data  
  4. Check rule order to avoid conflicts

### 🎯 Sample Questions

**Q1.** Context Data was successfully sent but does not appear in reports. What is the most likely reason?  

    A. ECID misconfiguration  
    B. Processing Rule mapping error  
    C. Missing consent update  
    D. Wrong timezone setting  

- **Answer:** B  
- **Explanation:** Context Data does not automatically appear in reports; it must be mapped via Processing Rules.  

---

**Q2.** A contextData variable `productCategory` is successfully sent, but eVar10 in the report is empty. What is the most likely cause?  

    A. Report Suite mismatch  
    B. Processing Rule not configured  
    C. ECID missing  
    D. Data Insertion API disabled  

- **Answer:** B  
- **Explanation:** Context Data must be explicitly mapped in Processing Rules to populate Analytics variables.  

---

**Q3.** Multiple contextData keys are sent, but only some values are showing in reports. What should be checked first?  

    A. Processing Rule priority and conflicts  
    B. Browser cache  
    C. ECID expiration  
    D. Report timezone  

- **Answer:** A  
- **Explanation:** Processing Rules are executed top-down; conflicts or overwrites can prevent some values from being applied.
