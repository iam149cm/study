### ✅ Quick Concept Learning

#### ⭐ ECID (Experience Cloud ID)
- Ref link: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/id-service/using/intro/overview

#### ☝🏻 Definition
- ECID is a unique identifier used across all Adobe Experience Cloud solutions (Analytics, Target, Audience Manager, etc.) to consistently identify users.  
- In the past, the `s_vi` cookie or AppMeasurement’s `visitorID` was used, but now the ECID service is the standard.

#### ✌🏻 Practical Points
- **Cross-domain tracking**: Essential when linking visitors across different domains.  
- **Session duplication**: If ECID is misconfigured, a single visitor can be counted multiple times.  
- **Debugging**: Verify that the `s_ecid` cookie matches the `mid` value in network requests.  
- **Exam Tip**: For visitor identification questions, 80% of the correct answers will relate to ECID.

#### ⭐ Web SDK vs AppMeasurement
- Ref link: https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/implementation/prepare/comparison  
- Web SDK is the modern data collection method, with strengths in unified tagging and real-time transmission.  
- During migration, consent configuration, data mapping, and server setup must be carefully reviewed.

#### ☝🏻 Web SDK (Alloy.js)
- Adobe’s latest data collection library, which supports unified tagging for Analytics, Target, and Audience Manager.  
- Sends data to the Edge Network for real-time processing and audience activation.

#### ✌🏻 AppMeasurement.js
- Legacy data collection script. Still widely used, but being gradually replaced by Web SDK.

#### 👉🏻 Migration Checklist
- Verify consent configuration (essential for GDPR/CCPA compliance)  
- Standardize data mapping (XDM schema design)  
- Ensure ECID service integration  
- Review server-side forwarding setup

### 🎯 Let’s try a quick sample question 🤗
#### Q1. After migrating to Web SDK, the number of Unique Visitors suddenly doubled. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
    A. Incorrect ECID configuration
    B. Wrong currency setting in the report suite
    C. Expired prop variable mapping
    D. Using an outdated Debugger extension

- **Answer**: A. Incorrect ECID configuration  

- **Explanation**: If ECID is not configured properly, a single visitor can be counted multiple times. Always validate ECID integration and cookie domain settings during migration.
