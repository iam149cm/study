### ✅ Mini Concept Learning: SDR (Solution Design Reference) & Implementation Planning

#### ☝🏻 What is SDR (Solution Design Reference)?  
- **Definition**: A design document that defines **the mapping between KPIs and Adobe Analytics variables**.  
- Lists the purpose, expiration, and format of each eVar, prop, and event.  
- Serves as a common reference for communication between developers, tagging specialists, and analysts before implementation.

#### ✌🏻 Implementation Planning  
- **Definition**: The process of translating KPIs into a measurable data collection structure.  
- General workflow:  
  1. Define business goals and KPIs  
  2. Identify what to measure  
  3. Write the SDR — map KPIs to eVar/prop/event  
  4. Implement tagging (Launch Rule setup)  
  5. Validate data (Debugger / Report check)

#### 👉🏻 Example: KPI → Variable Mapping  
| KPI | eVar | prop | event | Notes |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Sign-up Conversion Rate | eVar10 (Sign-up Channel) | prop5 (Page Name) | event15 (Sign-up Complete) | eVar Expiration: Visit |
| Cart Conversion Rate | eVar20 (Product ID) | prop10 (Category) | event30 (Add to Cart) | eVar Expiration: Purchase |

### 📝 Practical Points
- **Key SDR elements**
  - Variable name / ID / purpose / collection method / expiration / sample value  
  - Always describe KPI logic alongside its measurement approach.  
- **SDR management tips**
  - Apply version control (e.g., v1.0 → v1.1) to keep change history clear.  
  - Align Adobe Launch Rule names with SDR variable names.  
- **Exam highlights**
  - KPI ↔ variable mapping flow  
  - Design intent difference between eVar and prop  
  - Event setup precautions in SDR (prevent double-counting)

### 🎯 Practice Questions

**Q1.** What is the main purpose of the Solution Design Reference (SDR)?  

    A. To document the mapping between KPIs and Analytics variables  
    B. To generate real-time dashboards automatically  
    C. To configure data layer variables in Launch  
    D. To track ECID expiration  

**Answer: A**  
**Explanation:** The SDR defines how KPIs are mapped to eVar/prop/event variables in Adobe Analytics.  

---

**Q2.** In the implementation planning process, which step should occur **before** writing the SDR?  

    A. Data validation  
    B. Business goal and KPI definition  
    C. Launch rule setup  
    D. Report suite creation  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** KPIs must be defined before writing the SDR, since variable design depends on measurement goals.

**Q3.** Why is version control important when maintaining an SDR?  

    A. To avoid multiple developers editing the same file  
    B. To track changes in variable usage and prevent mismatches  
    C. To enable automatic publishing in Launch  
    D. To link the SDR to Workspace dashboards  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Version control helps trace variable updates and prevents discrepancies between documentation and implementation.
