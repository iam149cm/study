### ✅ Mini Concept Learning: eVar vs prop vs event

#### ☝🏻 eVar (Conversion Variable)  
- **Definition**: Stores values tied to visitor actions for conversion attribution analysis  
- Example: search keyword, acquisition channel  
- Value expiration depends on settings (e.g., visit, day, purchase)

#### ✌🏻 prop (Traffic Variable)  
- **Definition**: Traffic variable collected only at the hit level; no attribution  
- **Supports Pathing analysis** → shows the sequence of pages/buttons visited  
- Value always expires at the end of the hit/session

#### 👉🏻 event (Success Event, Metric)  
- **Definition**: Quantifies specific user actions (click, purchase, download, etc.)  
- Can be counter, increment, or currency-based  
- KPI design best practice: define which actions are tracked as events in the SDR

### 📝 Practical Points
- **Pathing vs Attribution**  
  - Pathing available: prop  
  - Attribution available: eVar (can persist and be tied to conversions)  
- **Expiration settings**  
  - eVar: configurable (Hit, Visit, Purchase, etc.)  
  - prop: always hit-based expiration  
- **KPI design & SDR notes**  
  - Clearly distinguish eVar, prop, and event roles in the SDR  
  - Example: “Search term” = eVar (attribution), “Page name” = prop (pathing), “Purchase” = event  
  - Ambiguity causes confusion in reporting and KPI tracking

### 🎯 Practice Questions

**Q1.** What is the key conceptual difference between an eVar and a prop?  

    A. eVars expire at page view  
    B. props enable attribution  
    C. props allow pathing analysis  
    D. eVars allow pathing analysis  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** props are hit-based and support pathing analysis, while eVars are used for attribution.

**Q2.** Which variable type should be used to measure a purchase completion action?  

    A. eVar  
    B. prop  
    C. event  
    D. segment  

**Answer: C**  
**Explanation:** Actions like purchase completions should be tracked as Success Events to measure KPIs.

**Q3.** When defining KPIs in an SDR, why is it important to clearly distinguish eVar, prop, and event?  

    A. To reduce the number of report suites required  
    B. To avoid confusion in reporting and ensure accurate analysis  
    C. To make pathing available for all variables  
    D. To extend expiration for all variables  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Clear separation of roles prevents reporting errors. Proper KPI design requires distinct definitions of eVar, prop, and event in the SDR.
