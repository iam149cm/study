### ✅ Mini Concept Study: Merchandising eVar & s.products

#### ☝🏻 What is a Merchandising eVar?
- **Definition**: An eVar variable that tracks product sales performance by connecting to product information
- Unlike regular eVars, it works by **binding** to product data (`s.products`)
- Can connect product information at various events, not just purchase, such as product views, cart additions, etc.

#### ✌🏻 s.products String Structure
- **Product Syntax**
  ```
  Category;Product;Quantity;Price;Events;eVars;Merchandising
  ```
  - Example: `Shoes;Running Shoes;1;99000;event1;eVar1=value1`
  - Fields are separated by semicolons (`;`)
  - Required: Category, Product (others are optional)
  
- **Category Syntax**
  ```
  Category1:Category2:Category3;Product;Quantity;Price;Events;eVars;Merchandising
  ```
  - Example: `Footwear:Athletic:Running;Running Shoes;1;99000`
  - Categories use colons (`:`) to represent hierarchical structure

#### 🤟🏻 s.products Field Details
|Field|Position|Description|Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Category|1|Product category (or hierarchy)|`Shoes` or `Footwear:Athletic:Running`|
|Product|2|Product name/ID (required)|`Running Shoes` or `PROD-12345`|
|Quantity|3|Quantity (optional, default: 1)|`2`|
|Price|4|Price (optional)|`99000`|
|Events|5|Event codes (optional)|`event1,event2`|
|eVars|6|eVar assignment (optional)|`eVar1=value1,eVar2=value2`|
|Merchandising|7|Merchandising eVar binding (optional)|`eVar10=value10`|

- **Multiple Product Transmission**
  ```js
  s.products = "Shoes;Running Shoes;1;99000;event1;eVar1=value1,Shirts;T-Shirt;2;29000;event1";
  ```
  - Multiple products are separated by commas (`,`)

### 📝 Practical Points

#### 1️⃣ Merchandising eVar Binding Principles
- **Product Syntax Binding**
  - Directly assigned in the 7th field of the `s.products` string
  - Example: `Shoes;Running Shoes;1;99000;;;eVar10=Blue`
  - Directly connected to the product and applied immediately
  
- **Conversion Variable Binding**
  - Set the eVar value at product view time, and automatically connect to `s.products` at purchase time
  - Binding events: `prodView`, `scOpen`, `scView`, `purchase`, etc.
  - Configuration: Admin → Report Suites → Conversion Variables → Merchandising settings

#### 2️⃣ Binding Event Types
|Event|Description|When to Use|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|`prodView`|Product detail page view|When visiting a product page|
|`scOpen`|Shopping cart open|When entering the cart page|
|`scView`|Shopping cart view|When viewing products in the cart|
|`purchase`|Purchase completed|When payment is completed|
|`scAdd`|Add to cart|When adding a product to the cart|

#### 3️⃣ Product Syntax vs Category Syntax Selection Criteria
- **Product Syntax**: When a single category or no hierarchical structure is needed
  - Example: `Electronics;Laptop;1;1200000`
- **Category Syntax**: When a multi-level category hierarchy is needed
  - Example: `Electronics:Computers:Laptops;Laptop;1;1200000`
  - Useful when creating category-specific reports

#### 4️⃣ Merchandising eVar Configuration Method
1. **Admin → Report Suites → Conversion Variables**
2. Select eVar → Enable **Merchandising**
3. Select **Binding Event** (prodView, scOpen, scView, purchase, etc.)
4. Select **Product Syntax** or **Category Syntax**
5. Set **Expiration** (usually Visit or Purchase)

### 🎯 Practice Questions

**Q1.** Which syntax should be used when you need to track a multi-level category hierarchy (e.g., Electronics > Computers > Laptops)?

    A. Product Syntax only  
    B. Category Syntax  
    C. Both syntaxes work the same way  
    D. Custom syntax required  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** Category Syntax uses colons (`:`) to represent hierarchical structure, making it suitable for tracking multi-level categories.

---

**Q2.** In the s.products string "Shoes;Running Shoes;1;99000;event1;eVar1=value1;eVar10=Blue", what does "eVar10=Blue" represent?

    A. A standard eVar assignment  
    B. A Merchandising eVar binding using Product Syntax  
    C. An event code  
    D. A category value  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The 7th field of the s.products string is the Merchandising eVar binding area, and it is directly connected to the product using Product Syntax.

---

**Q3.** When using Conversion Variable binding for a Merchandising eVar, which event triggers the binding when a user views a product detail page?

    A. purchase  
    B. prodView  
    C. scAdd  
    D. scOpen  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** The prodView event occurs when viewing a product detail page, and the eVar value set at this point is automatically bound to s.products at the time of purchase.

---

**Q4.** What is the correct format for sending multiple products in a single s.products variable?

    A. Use semicolons to separate products: "Product1;Product2"  
    B. Use commas to separate products: "Product1,Product2"  
    C. Use colons to separate products: "Product1:Product2"  
    D. Send separate s.products calls for each product  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** When sending multiple products, they are separated by commas (`,`), and each product's fields are separated by semicolons (`;`).

---

**Q5.** In the s.products string structure, which field is required?

    A. Category (field 1)  
    B. Product (field 2)  
    C. Quantity (field 3)  
    D. Price (field 4)  

**Answer: B**  
**Explanation:** In the s.products string, the Product field (2nd field) is required, and the remaining fields are optional.
