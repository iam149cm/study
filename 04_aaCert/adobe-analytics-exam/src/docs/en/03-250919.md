### ✅ Mini Concept Learning: Consent Management & Data Mapping

#### ☝🏻 What is Consent Management?  
A framework for managing user consent regarding personal data and cookies.  
- Opt-in: All data can be collected  
- Partial Consent: Analytics allowed, Advertising blocked  
- Opt-out: Cookies and personalized data collection blocked

#### ✌🏻 Privacy Service (GDPR/CCPA)  
- Delete Request: Deletes all Adobe Analytics data of a specific visitor  
- Access Request: Provides the visitor with a download of their own data  
- Opt-out Handling: Deletes ECID and stops further data collection

#### 👉🏻 Data Mapping  
Mapping consent levels to variables (eVar/prop/event) using Processing Rules / Data Elements.  
- Example: `Consent_Status = Opt-in / Opt-out` → Enables reporting segmented by consent level  
- Practical note: If data does not appear in reports, always check for consent refusal first.
