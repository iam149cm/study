### ✅ Mini Concept Learning: Reporting & Analysis Workspace

#### ☝🏻 What is Analysis Workspace?  
- **Definition**: The primary interface for visual analysis in Adobe Analytics.  
- Provides a drag-and-drop UI to build custom reports using Dimensions, Metrics, Segments, and Visualizations.  
- Enables creation of multiple Workspace projects as tailored dashboards.

#### ✌🏻 Segmentation  
- **Definition**: A method to filter visitors, visits, or hits that meet specific conditions.  
- **Segment Containers**  
  - Hit: filters individual page views or events  
  - Visit: includes all hits within a single session  
  - Visitor: applies to the user’s entire history  
- Nested segments can be combined for complex filtering logic.

#### 👉🏻 Calculated Metrics  
- **Definition**: Metrics created by combining existing metrics or formulas to form new KPIs.  
- Example: Conversion Rate = (Orders / Visits) × 100  
- Supports arithmetic operations, segmentation, and visualization-level calculations.

#### 🧭 Attribution Models  
- **Definition**: Methods for assigning credit for a conversion across multiple touchpoints.  
- Major models:  
  - **Last Touch** – assigns 100% credit to the last interaction  
  - **First Touch** – assigns 100% credit to the first interaction  
  - **Linear** – distributes equal credit to all touchpoints  
  - **Time Decay** – gives more weight to touchpoints closer in time to conversion

### 📝 Practical Points
- **Breakdown Visualization**  
  - Breaks down one dimension by another (e.g., Device Type → Product Category).  
  - Useful with Segments for analyzing user behavior paths.  

- **Flow Visualization**  
  - Visually displays user navigation paths (Entry → Interaction → Exit).  
  - Forward Flow shows next steps; Backward Flow reveals entry sources.  
  - Real-world use: Funnel analysis (Signup → Cart → Purchase).  

- **Workspace Tips**
  - Use Custom Panels to organize dashboards per project.  
  - Combine Calculated Metrics and Segments for dynamic KPI comparison.  
  - Choose appropriate visualizations: Freeform Table, Flow, Fallout, Summary Number, etc.
